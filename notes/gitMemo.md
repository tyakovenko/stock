### General Notes

- Every time you want to make any massive changes to the code create a new branch. The branch name should be something related to the new feature/changes to make it clear what it is used for
- All the branches use main as an upstream
- Adding onto main is only possible through a reviewed pull request - I'll deal with this but that's for general info
- For commit messages, make it clear what exact changes were made
- For any massive issues that exist, create an issue in the repository and it will be addressed
- At the end of each "sprint" all the functioning branches and features get pushed into main
