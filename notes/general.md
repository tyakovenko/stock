Summary: General notes on some coding practices to make it easier to understand what is going on in each of the files

### Naming Convention

- Pick one naming convention and use it for everything. Here are some examples of [naming conventions](https://www.itglue.com/blog/naming-conventions-examples-formats-best-practices/). I use camel case but you can just pick whatever is the easiest for you.
- This naming convention will be used on all variables and files that you include in your project
- All the variable and file names should reflect what it stands for. For example, if a coding file contains code for creating a bar chart call it barChart.py or something similar. If you create random names I'll make you change them until it makes sense :)
- Do not duplicate any of the variable names and try to not make them too long

### Code organization

- All of your files will be located on your own branch. I will create one and call it practice. All of your code will be in there but you will also have access to all the other branches/code related to the project
- I will create a separate folder with some practice problems which you can use as starter code
- For each new file that you create, include a comment at the top explaining what the file is for and include any dependencies/file interactions if necessary
- Please do not modify any of the code on my branches without letting me know because we will get conflicts that are hard to resolve when the code is combined.
- Every time you are done working for the day, you want to add, commit, and push all of your chnages onto your branch. This helps to keep track of the most up to date version of your progress and allows for better understanding of some challenges. The code you have if only visible to you (on local) until you push it to git.
